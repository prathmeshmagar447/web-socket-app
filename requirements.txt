# Core Python packages (usually included with Python 3.6+)
# This project uses only built-in Python modules:
# - socket (for network communication)
# - sqlite3 (for database operations)
# - threading (for concurrent operations)
# - json (for data serialization)
# - datetime (for timestamps)
# - os, sys (for system operations)

# No external dependencies required!
